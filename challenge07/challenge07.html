      <p class="card__verification_text">Verified Graduate</p>
      <p class="card__testimonials_text">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
        not
        more
        so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
      <p class="card__description">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make
        a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <h2 class="card__testimonials_text">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2>
      <p class="card__description"> “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a
        mobile engineer
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

      <h2 class="card__testimonials_text">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
        guidance from
        them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>
      <p class="card__description">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
        developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

      <h2 class="card__testimonials_text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <p class="card__description">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
        recommend! ”</p>
