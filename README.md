# Frontend Mentor - Challenges
This is the repository where I submit all my solutions for Frontend Mentor challenges

## How to navigate this repository
I don't create separated repository for every single challenge. Therefore my solutions couldn't make use of the great feature of comparing screenshot in Mentor Frontend.
When reviewing my solutions, you might need to go to my site & code, and select the challenge card to go into that specific challenge.

I tried to organize the repository so that every challenge will have its own directory and similar file structure, so you won't waste lots of time switching from one challenge to another.
 
**\<challenge_name>**: The directory for a specific challenge\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **\design**: store the design preview image\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **<challenge_name>.html**: the html for that challenge\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **style-guide.md**: The markdown contains the styling guidance for that specific challenge\
**\images**\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **\<challenge_name>**: contains the media for a specific challenges (e.g: ch01, ch02, etc.)\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **favicon-32x32.png**: the favicon shared by all pages\
**\scripts**: contain any javascript used\
**\styles**: contain all the styles\
&nbsp;&nbsp; | ---- **<challenge_name>.css**: Each challenge will have its own stylesheet (e.g., ch01.css, ch02.css, etc.)\
**index.html**: The "home page" where I list all the challenges as cards\
**attribution.html**: contains a list of attribution links to all the images I used in this repository\
